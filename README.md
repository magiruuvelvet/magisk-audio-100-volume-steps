# 100 Volume Steps

Simple Magisk module to raise the media volume steps to 100.

This module is inspired by [yzyhk904/audio-misc-settings](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/audio-misc-settings),
but without all the other modifications. The only thing this module does is raise the volume steps to 100.

I made this module because I want to have 100 volume steps, but the module by yzyhk904 was causing noticeable issues
with Bluetooth audio playback on my device.


## Modify volume steps

Simply change the volume steps in `service.sh` and `system.prop` and restart the device.
